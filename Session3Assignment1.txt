Hadoop has three major components: HDFS, YARN, and MapReduce. Components of HDFS and MapReduce are within all Master Nodes and Slave Nodes. One Master Node is composed of either YARN or MapReduce as a Resource Manager and HDFS. The HDFS part is the NameNode, which stores data. More nodes act as Master Nodes and contains Node Manager, Application Master and Data Node. The Slave Nodes in this area contain Node Manager and HDFS. The Data Node component in HDFS stores Big Data.
In hindsight the architecture of Hadoop 2.x works in this way. The Resource Manager is made up of the Scheduler and the Application Manager and Scheduler is responsible to schedule required resources to app and the Application Master executes tasks while interacting with Node Manager. The Node Managers are the master nodes as they manage the life cycle of the container and the utilization of resources. The containers within the data nodes of the master nodes hold part of the memory in HDFS.
